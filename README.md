The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Ford F-150 Lightning.

## Generations

The Ford F-150 Lightning has gone through two distinct generations:

- **First Generation (1993-1995)**: The original F-150 Lightning was developed by Ford's Special Vehicle Team (SVT) as a high-performance street truck. It featured a 5.8L V8 engine producing 240 hp and 340 lb-ft of torque, sport-tuned suspension, and distinct styling cues. This generation was based on the ninth-generation F-150 with a regular cab, short bed configuration, and was only available in black or red.

- **Second Generation (1999-2004)**: After a brief hiatus, the Lightning returned with significant improvements. Based on the tenth-generation F-150, it featured a supercharged 5.4L V8 engine initially producing 360 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque, later upgraded to 380 hp and 450 lb-ft for the 2001 model year. It maintained the regular cab, short bed configuration with enhanced suspension, braking, and exterior styling. This generation was capable of 0-60 mph in approximately 5.2 seconds.

- **Third Generation (2022-present)**: After a 17-year absence, the Lightning name was revived for Ford's first all-electric full-size pickup truck. Unlike its performance-oriented predecessors, the third-generation Lightning is a fully electric vehicle based on the fourteenth-generation F-150. It features dual electric motors providing all-wheel drive, with power outputs ranging from 452 hp in the standard-range model to 580 hp in the extended-range version. Battery options include a standard 98 kWh pack offering approximately 230 miles of range and an extended 131 kWh pack providing up to 320 miles. Notable features include vehicle-to-load capability allowing it to power homes or tools, a front trunk ("frunk") storage area, and advanced driver assistance systems.
