## Generations

The Ford F-150 Lightning is available in a single generation as an all-electric full-size pickup truck:

- **First Generation (2022-2025)**: Introduced in May 2021 and entering production in April 2022, the Lightning represented Ford's first all-electric pickup truck. Based on the fourteenth-generation F-150 with a dedicated electric vehicle architecture (Ford T3 platform), it featured dual permanent magnet motors providing standard all-wheel drive. Power output varied by battery configuration: 452 hp with the standard 98 kWh battery offering approximately 240 miles of EPA range, and 580 hp with the extended-range 131 kWh battery providing up to 320 miles of range. Both configurations produced 775 lb-ft of torque, enabling acceleration from 0-60 mph in the mid-four-second range for extended-range models. Notable innovations included a 400-liter front trunk with integrated power outlets, bi-directional vehicle-to-load capability delivering 9.6 kW for home backup power or job site tools, and BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology. Towing capacity reached 10,000 pounds with a maximum payload of 2,235 pounds. Trim levels included Pro (fleet), XLT, Lariat, and Platinum. Production continued at Ford's Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan until December 2025 when the model was discontinued due to profitability challenges.
