Based on the Ford T3 platform, it features dual permanent magnet motors providing all-wheel drive with power outputs of 452 hp for the standard battery and 580 hp for the extended-range battery, both producing 775 lb-ft of torque. Battery options include a 98 kWh usable pack offering an EPA-estimated 240 miles of range and a 131 kWh extended-range pack providing up to 320 miles. Key features include a 400-liter front trunk (frunk) with power outlets, vehicle-to-load capability providing 9.6 kW of export power for home backup or job site use, and advanced driver assistance including BlueCruise hands-free highway driving. Towing capacity reaches 10,000 pounds with a maximum payload of 2,235 pounds. Production occurred at Ford's Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, from April 2022 until December 2025 when Ford discontinued the model due to profitability challenges."
