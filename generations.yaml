generations:
  - name: "First Generation (SVT Lightning)"
    start_year: 1993
    end_year: 1995
    description: "The original Ford F-150 Lightning was developed by Ford's Special Vehicle Team (SVT) as a high-performance street truck. Based on the ninth-generation F-150, it featured a performance-tuned 5.8L (351 cubic inch) V8 engine producing 240 HP and 340 lb-ft of torque, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The suspension was significantly modified with specific shocks, springs, and anti-roll bars for improved handling. Visual distinctions included a unique front air dam, side exhaust, custom 17-inch alloy wheels, and Lightning-specific badging. Available only as a standard cab, short bed configuration in either black or red, approximately 11,500 units were produced over three years. This generation established the Lightning as Ford's performance truck, prioritizing on-road dynamics over traditional truck utility."

  - name: "Second Generation (SVT Lightning)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The second-generation Lightning was based on the tenth-generation F-150 and featured significantly more power and performance. Powered by a supercharged 5.4L V8 producing 360 HP (later increased to 380 HP) and 440 lb-ft of torque, it could accelerate from 0-60 mph in approximately 5.2 secondsâ€”impressive for a production truck of its era. The suspension was comprehensively modified with unique components, lower ride height, and performance-tuned dynamics. Visual enhancements included a specific front fascia, side steps, and distinctive 18-inch wheels. Available only as a standard cab, short bed configuration in limited colors, it offered a more refined interior with leather seats and Lightning-specific instrumentation. This generation elevated the Lightning's performance to supercar levels for its time while maintaining some utility with a 5,000-pound towing capacity. Production ended with no immediate successor as Ford shifted focus to off-road performance with the Raptor."

  - name: "Third Generation (Electric)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Lightning represents a complete reinvention of the nameplate as Ford's first all-electric full-size pickup truck. Based on the fourteenth-generation F-150 but with a specific electric vehicle architecture, it features dual electric motors providing standard all-wheel drive and up to 580 HP and 775 lb-ft of torque in extended-range models, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration in the mid-4-second range. Available in standard (98 kWh usable) or extended-range (131 kWh usable) battery configurations, it offers EPA-estimated ranges of 230 and 320 miles respectively. The Lightning maintains traditional F-150 utility with up to 2,235 pounds of payload capacity and 10,000 pounds of towing capacity. Innovative features include a 400-liter front trunk (frunk) with power outlets, bi-directional power capability to serve as a home backup power source, and advanced driver assistance features including BlueCruise hands-free driving. Available in Pro, XLT, Lariat, and Platinum trims, the Lightning combines the familiar F-150 design and capability with the advantages of electric propulsion, representing Ford's vision for the electrified future of its most important product line."
